### My history

Since this is an R markdown, you can use everything that you learned about to make templates and how to do other things such as insert images and links in the page.

below the template had a linked wiki page and a movie?

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
